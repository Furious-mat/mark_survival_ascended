# Decraft
It's like a crafting table, but in reverse!
Make sure to input the correct number of items (e.g. putting in one fence won't do anything, you have to put in four because fences are crafted in batches of four).
The decrafting table doesn't work with groups, so sticks, wood, and other grouped items will likely be lost in decrafting.
