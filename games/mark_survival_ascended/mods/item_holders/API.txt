Node Definitions

ic_mods: (Table), overlay images, every value is applied to their respective slot.

pre_entity_mod(ent, pos): (Function), execute a function before the entity functions.
pos_entity_mod(ent, pos): (Function), execute a function after the entity functions.

preitem(i): (Function), i = itempos in slots, adds some image modifier before the actual image, good for using stuff like [combine:.
positem(i): (Function), i = itempos in slots, adds some image modifier after the image, used to close preitem(i) if used, but can also be used for ^[colorize, etc.

itemcase: (String), define either as 'items' or 'armors', that one for item showcases and the other for armorstands and the like.
is_itemcase: (Boolean), false by default, set to true so the entity works.

itemcase2: (Number), 1 by default, if 2 then it will draw the images on top and bottom of the entity rather than front and back.

itemplacehold: (Texture), define which texture is the placeholder for when here no items in the item holder.
background: (Texture), this will always be BEHIND the main texture, used for shelves and the like when here's no need for sense of deepth.

delete_unused: (Boolean), false by default, when set to true, entity won't show IF here's no item to display.

moveitem: (Table), define where to move the entity, must be less than 0.50 and more than -0.50.
(example): (This is the same as the display shelf!)
    moveitem = {
		[0] = {x=0,y=0,z= 0.45},
		[1] = {x= 0.45,y=0,z=0},
		[2] = {x=0,y=0,z= -0.45},
		[3] = {x= -0.45,y=0,z=0},
