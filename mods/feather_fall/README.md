# feather-fall

Holding this feather makes you light as it

## What's in the box

- A item when held in the players hand will allow any negative velocity to become reduced to a slow enough speed that no fall damage will be taken
- Optional crafting of the feather

## How to enable crafting

Just add `feather_fall.craftable = true` to your `minetest.conf` (and restart if needed).

> First run will create this setting to false, so you could just run it first then edit your `minetest.conf`.
